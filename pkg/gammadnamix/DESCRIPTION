Description: gammadnamix contains procedures for optimisation, integrate and
    MCMC for likelihoods of a quantitative gamma model for replicated
    STR DNA mixtures for a general specifications of hypotheses. It also does
    deconvolution with the optimized model to take care of drop-out, drop-in
    and stutters.
